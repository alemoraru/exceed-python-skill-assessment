| 1 | [**Evaluation of Python Error Message Interpretation: Study on Students with Different Levels of Programming Experience**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/376063170_Evaluation_of_Python_Error_Message_Interpretation_Study_on_Students_with_Different_Levels_of_Programming_Experience) | September 2023 | How does past programming experience influence bug fixing ability and time taken to find errors in Python? | Error message interpretation and fixing speed | Experienced programmers were significantly better at correctly finding and fixing bugs. Correlations found between fixing success and number of programming languages known (as well as chosen major and their age). |
| 2 | [**Frequency Distribution of Error Messages**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.07238) | September 2015 | Which programming error messages are most common among novices in Python and Java? | Error message frequency patterns (Java & Python collected data) | Error messages follow Zipf-Mandelbrot distribution; a few types of errors account for most occurrences. Syntax errors are the most frequent. |
| 3 | [**Rule-Based Error Classification for Analyzing Differences in Frequent Errors**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00513) | November 2023 | Create a rule-based tool to classify syntax and logic errors and analyze differences between novice and expert programmers. | Types and patterns of errors made by different skill levels (Python collected data) | Novice errors stem from lack of fundamental knowledge; expert errors come from misreading problems. |
| 4 | [**Meaningful categorisation of novice programmer errors**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280314826_Meaningful_Categorisation_of_Novice_Programmer_Errors) | October 2014 | Can student errors be categorized objectively and what are the most common errors? | Error patterns and frequency distribution (Java collected data) | Top 10 Java errors account for 59% of all errors; human analysis categorizes errors more accurately than compiler messages. |
| 5 | [**Common logic errors made by novice programmers**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322352077_Common_logic_errors_made_by_novice_programmers) | January 2018 | What are the most common logic errors students make and which are most problematic to fix? | Types of logic errors and difficulty in fixing them (C collected data) | Misconceptions are the most frequent source of logic errors and the most difficult to resolve. |
| 6 | [**An analysis of patterns of debugging among novice computer science students**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220807559_An_analysis_of_patterns_of_debugging_among_novice_computer_science_students) | September 2005 | How do debugging patterns differ among students and what is the relationship with programming ability? | Debugging capability vs programming ability (Java collected data) | Good debuggers are usually good programmers, but less than half of good programmers are good debuggers. |
| 7 | [**Detection and Categorization of Errors by Novice Programmers in a First Year Java Programming Class: A Comparative Analysis**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281120221_Detection_and_Categorization_of_Errors_by_Novice_Programmers_in_a_First_Year_Java_Programming_Class) | May 2015 | Can early tutorials on Java programming errors help reduce novice mistakes? | Impact of error awareness on performance (Java collected data) | Early tutorials reduce syntax and runtime errors but logical errors remain challenging. |
| 8 | [**Identifying and Correcting Java Programming Errors for Introductory Computer Science Students**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221537221_Identifying_and_correcting_Java_programming_errors_for_introductory_computer_science_students) | January 2003 | What are common Java errors for beginners and how to create an educational tool to address them? | Understanding of language intricacies (Java collected data) | Identified 62 common errors, with 20 being essential; syntax and semantic errors are most prevalent. |
| 9 | [**Common mistakes made by novice programmers: A comparison between Java and Python**](https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/3095918/no.ntnu%3Ainspera%3A145904930%3A33241516.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) | June 2023 | How do novice errors compare between Java and Python? | Language-specific vs universal error patterns (Java & Python collected data) | Many errors are prevalent across both languages, suggesting shared challenges for novices. |
| 10 | [**Visualizing Code Patterns in Novice Programmers**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325705515_Visualizing_Code_Patterns_in_Novice_Programmers) | May 2018 | How to identify and visualize poor coding habits and their correlation with confidence levels? | Coding habits and confidence levels (Java collected data) | Bad habits can be automatically identified; confidence levels correlate with error frequency. Students who are more confident exhibit fewer bad habits. |
| 11 | [**Novice/expert differences in programming skills**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0020737385800419) | October 1985 | Do expert programmers demonstrate automation in low-level programming tasks? | Speed and accuracy in routine tasks (Fortran experimentsâ€¦old study) | Experts were twice as fast and more accurate, showing automation of basic skills. |
| 12 | [**Categorizing Compiler Error Messages with Principal Component Analysis**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308888663_Categorizing_Compiler_Error_Messages_with_Principal_Component_Analysis) | May 2016 | Are there hidden relations between different types of compiler errors? | Error correlation patterns (Java collected data) | Related errors cluster together; students who make one type often make related errors. First paper to use PCA to categorize compiler errors. |
| 13 | [**All syntax errors are not equal**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254462853_All_syntax_errors_are_not_equal) | July 2012 | Which syntax errors are most common and time-consuming to resolve? | Error resolution time and frequency (Java collected data) | Some errors consume disproportionate time for all skill levels; higher performers resolve certain errors faster. |
