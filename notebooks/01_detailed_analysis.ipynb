    "# EXCEED Python Qualtrics Survey - Detailed Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a detailed analysis of the EXCEED Python Qualtrics survey data. It includes data loading, cleaning, and various analyses to understand the survey responses better. The ultimate goal of this analysis is to find the best subset of questions that can best differentiate between Python _beginner_/_novice_ and _advanced_/_expert_ users.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Qualtrics survey is composed of the following blocks, where each participant is required to answer all questions in each block. Note that for blocks 3 to 8, each respondent is given a random subset of 2 out of the 7 available questions, hence the total number of survey-related questions is 16. The blocks are as follows:\n",
    "1. **Consent Form**: Participants agree to take part in the survey. If they do not agree, they are redirected to the end of the survey.\n",
    "2. **Self-assessment**:\n",
    "    1. **Python Experience**: Participants self-assess their Python experience using Dreyfus levels.\n",
    "    2. **Python Programming YoE**: Participants indicate their years of experience with Python programming.\n",
    "    3. **General Programming YoE**: Participants indicate their years of experience with programming in general.\n",
    "3. **General Programming Error Understanding**: 7 questions\n",
    "4. **Python-Specific General Error Understanding**: 7 questions\n",
    "5. **Code Reading / Understanding**: 7 questions\n",
    "6. **Error Message Comprehension**: 7 questions\n",
    "7. **Error Resolution**: 7 questions\n",
    "8. **Error Message Comprehension**: 7 questions\n",
    "9. **Natural Language Scenarios**: 7 questions\n",
    "10. **Miscellanous Questions - Various Complexity & Scope**: 7 questions\n",
    "11. **Self-Assessment of Results**: Participants self-assess the number of questions they answered correctly in the survey (0 to 16)."

Additionally, this step will also skip any items that have fewer than 10 valid answers (i.e., completed) to avoid unstable discrimination index calculations. To the best of our knowledge, such questions do not exist in the current dataset, but this is a good practice to follow in general.\n",

    "## Step 5: Filter Questions for Acceptable Difficulty Range & Display All Items\n",
    "\n",
    "This step filters the questions based on the acceptable difficulty range (0.25 <= p <= 0.85) and displays all items ranked by their discrimination index (r_pb). This will help us understand which questions are more effective in differentiating between beginner/novice and advanced/expert users. In terms of output, this step does the following:\n",
    "- Displays the number of survey questions considered before filtering for acceptable difficulty range. This number should be 56, since there are 7 questions in each of the 8 blocks (3 to 10).\n",
    "- Displays the number of survey questions considered after filtering for acceptable difficulty range.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: This is still not the final subset of questions, but rather a preliminary step to identify the best questions based on their difficulty and discrimination index. On top of that, we will also vary the actual difficulty range in follow-up steps to find the best subset of questions that can differentiate between beginner/novice and advanced/expert users."
