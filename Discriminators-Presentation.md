| Finding | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Common Java Errors | Common Java syntax errors include incorrect comparison operators, confusing short-circuit evaluations, wrong sign ordering, and missing parentheses after method calls. |
| Cross-Language Issues | Shared challenges exist for novices in both Python and Java. |
| Bad Habits | Bad habits correlate with higher error frequency, linked to developers' confidence levels. |
| Expert vs Novice | Experts fix errors twice as fast and accurately as novices, indicating automated basic skills. |
| Error Patterns | When it comes to Java, students making one type of error often make related ones (e.g., omitting brackets). |
| Resolution Time | Errors like `Cannot resolve identifier` take disproportionate time; faster resolution by higher-performing students for some errors. |
| Debugging Techniques | Experts use systematic debugging techniques; novices benefit from reference guides. |
| Common Error Types | In Java, mismatched quotes are less common than expected; top errors involve variable scope, type mismatches, and syntax nuances. |
