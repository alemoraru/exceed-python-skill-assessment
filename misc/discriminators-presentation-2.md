| Finding | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Programming Experience | Experienced programmers are better at finding and fixing bugs but not necessarily faster. |
| Error Distribution | Python/Java error messages follow a Zipf-Mandelbrot distribution; `SyntaxError: invalid syntax` is most common, followed by `NameError`. |
| Knowledge Gaps | Novices lack fundamental knowledge while experts misread problems. |
| Error Analysis | Top 10 errors make up 59% of all errors; human analysis is more accurate than compiler messages. `Variable not declared` is most frequent in Java (11.1%). |
| Misconceptions | Misconceptions are common and challenging to resolve, leading to logic errors. |
| Debugging Skills | Good debuggers often excel at programming, but not vice versa. |
| Tutorial Impact | Early tutorials reduce syntax/runtime errors in Java; logical errors persist. |
