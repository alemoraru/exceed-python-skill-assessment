    "# High-Level Results Analysis for Qualtrics Python Skill Level Survey\n",
    "\n",
    "This document provides a high-level analysis of the results from the Qualtrics Python Skill Level Survey. The goal of the survey was to objectively assess the Python skill levels of participants, by placing them into one of the 2 categories: _Beginner_/_Novices_ and _Advanced_/_Experts_. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ultimate goal is to identify the best subset of questions that can effectively differentiate between these two skill levels. The actual content of the survey is centered around several aspects of Python programming error messages, and debugging techniques. The underlying assumption is that individuals with more experience in Python (and perhaps even general programming experience) will have a better understanding of error identification, resolution, and debugging strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual metrics that are captured in this analysis include:\n",
    "- **Completion Rate**: The percentage of participants who started and completed the survey.\n",
    "- **Average duration**: The average time (in seconds) taken by participants to complete the survey.\n",
    "- **Median duration**: The median time (in seconds) taken by participants to complete the survey.\n",
    "- **Average Python YoE**: The average number of years of experience participants have with Python.\n",
    "- **Average Programming YoE**: The average number of years of experience participants have with programming in general.\n",
    "- **Average Self-reported score**: The average self-reported score of correctly answered questions (out of 16 questions).\n",
    "- **Correlation between self-reported score and Python YoE**: The correlation coefficient between the self-reported correct answers score and the number of years of experience with Python.\n",
    "- **Correlation between self-reported score and Programming YoE**: The correlation coefficient between the self-reported correct answers score and the number of years of experience with programming in general."
